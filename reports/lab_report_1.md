## Progress Summary
This week, our team expanded with the addition of new members, ensuring their seamless integration into our core communication platforms such as Discord, Whatsapp. Additionally, we organized sub-teams for backend, frontend, and mobile development, while deliberating on potential technologies to drive our project forward.
