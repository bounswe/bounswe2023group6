### 4. Evaluation of the status of deliverables
- **Software Requirements Specifications:** During first weeks of the semester there was an incertainty on what to include and exclude in the project such as the game pages, character pages etc. Also there was some uncertainty about the recommendation algorithm. One of those uncertainties was on what aspects of the posts-games to make recommendations to users. We spent quite some time on alicitation process, and negotiated with the product owner. We made clear on what aspects to make suggestions however the algorithm is to be determined. Since algorithm is not a part of the requirements, we can safely assume that the specifications are altered in accordance with the decisions made on the aforementioned issues and they are complete.
 
- **Software Design(UML Diagrams):** Since there were not that much of a change on the general project structure, we needed minor changes in the UML designs. After deciding on which concepts to include and exclude, we quickly worked over the class diagram. Class diagrams describe the general relation among the numerous entities that are planned to be present in the project, and it can be considered to be the backbone for the backend architecture. That’s why we reviewed it. Game, character classes were added and event class was discarded. The second diagram is the usecase diagram. Use case diagrams are means to describe the functionalities that are offered to the all actors of the system, i.e. administrators and different types of users. Respective changes are made to the usecase diagram as well. Lastly the sequence diagram. Since not much of the functionalities of the system were covered in the first milestone, we did not worked exclusively on sequence diagrams. We completed them after the first two diagrams were rafinated enough. All in all it is also safe to say that UML diagrams are complete from the current state of the project.
 
- **Scenarios and Mockups:** Mockups and scenarios are a great means to describe the intentions of a project to the customers and possible future users. We believe that the mockups and scenarios we prepared during the last year’s course were reflecting the intentions of us on the future of the project. Again, the major changes required were related to the game and character pages. Those requirements were also met by our team, and the respective changes were added to the mockups and scenarios.
 
- **Project Plan:** Project plan is an integral part of the process of effectively managing a project. We believe in the potential advantages of having one is crucial to a successful development environment. To this end, we made sure that our plan encompassed all the possible tasks. We were not only able to complete all the predetermined tasks, but also we successfully completed the unforeseen tasks as well.
 
- **RAM:** RAMs are crucial in that they allow the team members to see who contributed to which tasks, and enable them to load balance the tasks on the individuals. Therefore, we paid special attention to having a proper responsibility assignment matrix.
 
- **Individual Contribution Reports: ** Although the RAM shows who contributed on building which parts of the project, it could be quite misleading. Some tasks might have required more effort than others, which cannot be concluded just by looking at the RAM, but additional information is required to assess the effort of individuals. ICRs serve exactly this purpose.
 
- **Software:** We were asked to build two applications one for mobile and the other for the web. Therefore we divided into three equal teams: backend, mobile, and frontend to meet the expactations properly. We believe that our teams successfully met the requirements of the first milestone’s targets. Our backend team started the development first and exposed some endpoints for the other teams to develop their ends on them. After building the basis, all teams made some adjustments in their end for better integration among the teams. Finally, the application is successfully deployed and can be accessed through the [link]( http://game-lounge.com/home).
