# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Group 6 - Game Forum

**Date:** 10.10.2023

## Progress Summary
**This week** focused on making decisions to make our project domain-specific. We divided our teams for the back-end, the front-end, and the mobile. We decided on the main technologies that will be used. We couldn't make updates to the class diagram and the use case diagram. **Our objective for the following week** will be to updating requirements, use case, class and sequence diagrams. Also, learning technologies that we will use.

## Planned vs. Actual
- We decided due date of refactoring requirements too short. However this task can take a few weeks more. We could't finished the task but we decided some requirements.
- We planned update the use case, class and sequence diagram. However, we spent so much time to make our project domain-specific. Therefore, we couldn't start updating.
