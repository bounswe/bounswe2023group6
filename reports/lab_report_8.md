# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Group 6 - Game Lounge

**Date:** 05.12.2023

## Progress Summary
**This week** we focused on Milestone 2 presentation:
- Added games to homepage
- Integrate posts and games to backend
- Added game and post creation pop-ups
- Implemented comment, report and like features
- Deployed our project

**Our objective for the following week** is to make improvements according to feedbacks from Milestone 2 and handle the negative feedback. We will complete missing features especially in forum, game and profile pages. Also, we will start to implement admin and annotation features.

## Report Task
First priority is the 'in progress' statuses that are located in the [Progress according to requirements for Milestone 2](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group6/wiki/Progress-according-to-requirements-for-Milestone-2-%E2%80%90-(not-started)-(in-progress)-(completed)) which was prepared for the Milestone 2 report since they are in progress. Our second priority is the requirements relating to the Recommendation and Annotation staff because of the two reasons. One reason is that the recommendation feature is the most important feature that will use our domain-specific parts, which are relating to the game and character staffs, of our platform. Second reason is that we will be learned about the JSON-LD method and IRI after implementing the annotation feature. The rest requirement is the our third priorities. 

You can see the all priorities depicted as (1) standing for first priority, (2) standing for second priority, and (3) standing for third priority besides to the [requirements](https://github.com/bounswe/bounswe2023group6/wiki/The-Priorities-of-the-Requirements).
