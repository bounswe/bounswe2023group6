# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Group 6 - Game Lounge

**Date:** 12.12.2023

## Progress Summary
Over the past week, the team made significant progress on various aspects of the project. Key areas of focus included both front-end and back-end developments, mobile enhancements, and the implementation of new features.

- Front-end tasks involved editing the post page and improving general styling, ensuring a more user-friendly interface.
- Back-end efforts concentrated on creating new endpoints for game-related forum sections, admin approval mechanisms, and AWS S3 fixes.
- Mobile development included adding filtering and sorting to post pages and comments, as well as profile enhancements.
- Additionally, tasks like annotation research and integrating images into forum posts were undertaken.

**Our objective for the following week** is to make improvements according to feedbacks from last week and handle the negative feedback. We will complete missing features especially in forum, lfg and profile pages. Also, we will continue to implement admin and annotation features.
