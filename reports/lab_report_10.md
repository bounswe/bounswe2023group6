# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Group 6 - Game Lounge

**Date:** 19.12.2023

## Progress Summary
Over the past week, the team made significant progress on various aspects of the project. Due to numerous implementations, the frontend and mobile teams maintained constant communication with the backend team. Based on the feedback exchanged between teams regarding the implemented features, they proceeded with their task or making updates to completed sections as necessary. Key areas of focus included both front-end and back-end developments, mobile enhancements, and the implementation of new features. 

- Front-end tasks involved editing the post page, improving general styling, edit game page and fixing bugs and updating requests that related to games.
- Back-end efforts concentrated on implementing the recommendation algorithm, LFG endpoints and fixing game rating.
- Mobile development included adding filtering and sorting to post pages and comments, as well as profile enhancements and updating requests that related the games.
- Additionally, tasks like annotation research were undertaken.

**Our objective for the following week** is to complete the remaining tasks from the past two weeks' planning, resolve conflicts, fixing the bugs and finalize the sections related to group recommendations Also, we will continue to implement admin and annotation features.

## Planned vs. Actual
Due to numerous updates made in the project last week, many features require reassessment and adaptation to their new versions. As several issues are dependent to each other, we were unable to fully complete the two-week plan we had initially designed. However, a significant part of the plan has been accomplished even though they require minor updates to be finalized and closed.
