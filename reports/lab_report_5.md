# Project Development Weekly Progress Report

**Team Name:** Group 6 - Game Lounge

**Date:** 07.11.2023

## Progress Summary
**This week** we focused on Milestone 1:
- Preparing a presentation to show the authentication process (registration, login, log out, change password, and forgot password).
- Preparing a scenario with the mock data, which was helpful in making a presentation.
- Completing the deliverables by sharing those with the team members.

**Our objective for the following week** is to handle the negative feedback and profile page in one week. Also, we will start to code the game page, whose deadline will be two weeks.
